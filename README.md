# VCL Syntax Highlighting Plugin

Forked from https://github.com/brandonwamboldt/sublime-varnish and adapted for Visual Studio Code.

Sublime uses the TmLanguage format as well. In the branch _vscode_, all the files from the original repository were kept, and the additional files required to treat it a s VSCode extension were added. This way, we will be able to include further changes from upstream.
